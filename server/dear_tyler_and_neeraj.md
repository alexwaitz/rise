# How I'd write the rest of the app:

Make it an app for teachers and schools to sign up and create a platform for students to improve grades. That's how I'd sell it.

specific points:

- make an option to only show top 10 to not discourage students who are at the bottom
- make a page for prizes set by the teacher
